# Prediction-of-Agriculture-Crop-Production-in-India
Agricultural Crop Production Prediction System
A machine learning-based system for predicting agricultural crop yields across different regions of India based on environmental and agricultural parameters.
Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive pipeline for predicting crop production in India using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes historical crop data along with various environmental factors such as soil characteristics, weather conditions, and agricultural inputs to make accurate yield predictions.
Features

Data preprocessing pipeline for agricultural datasets
Implementation of multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, etc.)
Comprehensive model evaluation and comparison
Web application for farmers and agricultural experts to make predictions
Visualization of prediction results and model performance
